# projectlandingpage

This is my implementation of the landing page project from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page#project-solution

<h1>Post-project Reflextion (Sep. 1, 2024):</h1>

Through this project, I learned:
- Flexbox is a great tool for positioning containers and items
- Everything can be thought of as nested containers with items in them
- I neeh to remember that header and paragraph tags exist and use them
- Literally drawing boxes on a sheet of paper can help with planning
- I should increase how often I commit to git
- I should write better commit messages

Things I see that would improve my implementation:
- I should have used more containers, especially in the intro/header section
- Use header and paragraph tags to reduce typing and lines of code
- The body is not using flex while everything in it is - this should probably have also been flex
